    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about Journalism a lot lately. As many are aware, the industry has been in trouble for a few years now. Reader-ship and subscriptions are down at every local newspaper, and increased dependence on advertisments are way up. Many local newspapers have had to shut down or severely decrease their staff. This is not good for the future. Where we get our news is a strong piller of democracy. We must be informed to be able to make wise decisions about big issues like war and pollution, as well as seemingly insignificant issues like installing a stop sign at the corner.</p>

<p>While advertising is currently seen as the answer to fix journalism and make it profitable &ndash; with the likes of New York Times and The Atlantic pushing this forward &ndash; the close conection between &lsquo;sponsored content&rsquo; and real jounalism is unnerving, to say the least. When the same jounalist spends the morning on a sponsored piece about how amazing Google Chrome is and the afternoon on a piece about Google and security &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to imagine unbiased reporting in either case. While this example may sound unlikely &ndash; it&rsquo;s a lot closer to reality than most would believe. It&rsquo;s clear to me we need to fix this, and individual paid subscriptions doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the answer (not everyone is like New York Times and can command a monthly fee).</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t an easy problem to solve, and will most likely require multiple solutions to properly fix&hellip;I do think something similar to Spotify for Jounalism could prove useful. The same way artists were losing their money to illegal downloads in the 2000s, Journalism is losing money and eyes to free content. Although it requires people willing to pay for what they read &ndash; I personally would be very receptive to paying a monthly fee that directly pays the journalists of content I read. While this would still require newspapers to report on tough issues vs. popular ones &ndash; it does provide an easier method of gaining revenue.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although this may seem like its been discussed a lot recently, I&rsquo;ve been thinking more and more about upgrading my iPad 2.  I recently got back from Japan, and it was great traveling without a computer &ndash; but I&rsquo;ve found that I generally only use my tablet when I travel.  And it&rsquo;s only if I don&rsquo;t have my computer with me.  The tablet was great back when my laptop&rsquo;s batteries didn&rsquo;t last as long.  But what&rsquo;s the use of them anymore?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Using the iPad as the CNS to power things in your apartment is a good use case&hellip;however I still turn to my phone more and more.  And with the increase in the size of the iPhone 6, do I even need the extra screen real-estate?  For cooking it could be nice, but only marginally.  It&rsquo;s interesting how fast that fad came and went.  The original iPad was released April, 2010 &ndash; in 5 quick years it went from the IT item to no longer relevant.  This becomes even more interesting with the upcoming release of the iWatch.  How long will smart-watches continue to be relevant.  Will they also experience a bubble like the iPad?  Or will they live on like our phones.</p>

<p>Personally, I think smart-watches are doomed to fail.  I enjoy coming home, placing my phone away and not being connected for a little bit.  With a watch, you&rsquo;re always connected.  And you always have to be connected.  The cons definitely outweigh the pros.  We&rsquo;ll see if others agree with me on this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I usually visit Economist.com a couple of times per week &ndash; generally a great place to catch up on world headlines.  Recently, I came across an article they posted about UFO sightings.  In it, they analyze data from the National UFO Reporting Centre about reported UFO sightings from the US &ndash; breaking it down by time of day.  Basically they allude that there is a peak in reported sightings during &ldquo;Drinking Hours&rdquo;.  While I agree most sightings (if not all) do require some added influence of some sort (i.e. alcohol) &ndash; there are confounding variables that may also lead to increased sightings in the evenings.  A few additional reasons include &ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li>During Working Hours, most people are indoors and busy</li>
<li>It is easier to spot things in the sky at night</li>
<li>During Sleeping Hours &ndash; most people are asleep (indoors, preoccupied, unable to watch the sky)</li>
</ul>


<p>So it makes perfect sense that most reported sightings are during &ldquo;Drinking Hours&rdquo;.  That also happens to be the time that its best to notice things in the sky and also the time when most people are able to be outside and focus on things outside of working or sleeping.  It&rsquo;s always interesting to me when a trusted publication like the Economist makes blatant errors in reporting and statistics &ndash; but goes to show analysis errors are all around us.</p>
