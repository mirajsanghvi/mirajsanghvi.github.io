        <p>Free Agency, it&rsquo;s a normal part of sports and really a beautiful concept. The idea that after the grueling season, you get some time to talk to different teams and figure out where you might be the best fit. Although I didn&rsquo;t start this process with that mindset &ndash; I&rsquo;m starting to understand the beauty of it more and more. For some context &ndash; I recently left my role at VigLink without anything else lined up! I recently got married decided this would be a great time to change things up professionally.</p>

<p>The more I think about it, everyone should do a &ldquo;free agency&rdquo; period throughout their careers. Although I&rsquo;m only doing this now&hellip;after I&rsquo;ve gained enough confidence in my skills and ability to get another job when needed &ndash; it has turned out to be even more rewarding than initially imagined. The thought of constantly bouncing from one job to the next, without a clear understanding of where I wanted to be in 5 or 10 years is part of the reason that I chose to enter &ldquo;free agency&rdquo;. But one of the main driving factors was also not exactly knowing what I wanted to do next. It&rsquo;s hard enough working a full-time job and trying to interview at a couple of places&hellip;and most people (in the tech industry) rely on recruiters to reach out to them about interesting jobs. But there are so many awesome opportunities out there &ndash; and the only way to find them is through searching for them or getting connected to them through friends/acquaintances.</p>

<p>Basically the past month has been spent searching through the web for interesting companies, using AngelList and LinkedIn to make connections and setting up multiple phone chats/coffee meetings. Although it has been stressful at times, most weeks have been very rewarding! The chance to really think about the next role and imagine yourself there for 4 to 5 years is exciting. After bouncing from roles after 2 or 3 years &ndash; I&rsquo;m excited at figuring out where I&rsquo;ll land. And a great added perk has been the ability to connect with old friends and coworkers that I haven&rsquo;t chatted with in a long time. Hearing what others are up to and catching up has been one of the best ways to sort out what I want to do next &ndash; and learning about new opportunities.</p>

<p>So if you have the opportunity to take 1-2 months off of work and are thinking of changing things up professionally, I highly recommend entering free agency! It&rsquo;s a full-time job networking and interviewing, but highly rewarding.</p>
