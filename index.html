  <h2><a href="/blog/2016/08/31/imposter-syndrome/">Imposter Syndrome</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Imposter Syndrome is not a new concept. You can find countless blogs and articles talking about this occurrence in software engineering as well as most specialized fields. The feeling of not knowing everything is understandable&hellip;since there is always something new out there. A new programming language, a new way to build your code, a new editor to use, etc. And it does help to know that most everyone feels this multiple times a week, helps make it easier to deal with on a regular basis.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2016/08/23/journalism/">Journalism</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about Journalism a lot lately. As many are aware, the industry has been in trouble for a few years now. Readership and subscriptions are down at every local newspaper, and increased dependence on advertisements are way up. Many local newspapers have had to shut down or severely decrease their staff. This is not good for the future. Where we get our news is a strong pillar of democracy. We must be informed to be able to make wise decisions about big issues like war and pollution, as well as seemingly insignificant issues like installing a stop sign at the corner.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/03/28/tablets/">Tablets</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Although this may seem like its been discussed a lot recently, I&rsquo;ve been thinking more and more about upgrading my iPad 2.  I recently got back from Japan, and it was great traveling without a computer &ndash; but I&rsquo;ve found that I generally only use my tablet when I travel.  And it&rsquo;s only if I don&rsquo;t have my computer with me.  The tablet was great back when my laptop&rsquo;s batteries didn&rsquo;t last as long.  But what&rsquo;s the use of them anymore?</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2014/06/29/economist-and-ufos/">Economist and UFOs</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I usually visit Economist.com a couple of times per week &ndash; generally a great place to catch up on world headlines.  Recently, I came across an article they posted about UFO sightings.  In it, they analyze data from the National UFO Reporting Centre about reported UFO sightings from the US &ndash; breaking it down by time of day.  Basically they allude that there is a peak in reported sightings during &ldquo;Drinking Hours&rdquo;.  While I agree most sightings (if not all) do require some added influence of some sort (i.e. alcohol) &ndash; there are confounding variables that may also lead to increased sightings in the evenings.  A few additional reasons include &ndash;</p>




<ul>
<li>During Working Hours, most people are indoors and busy</li>
<li>It is easier to spot things in the sky at night</li>
<li>During Sleeping Hours &ndash; most people are asleep (indoors, preoccupied, unable to watch the sky)</li>
</ul>




<p>So it makes perfect sense that most reported sightings are during &ldquo;Drinking Hours&rdquo;.  That also happens to be the time that its best to notice things in the sky and also the time when most people are able to be outside and focus on things outside of working or sleeping.  It&rsquo;s always interesting to me when a trusted publication like the Economist makes blatant errors in reporting and statistics &ndash; but goes to show analysis errors are all around us.</p>

  <p>
    <p><strong>Hello, World!</strong>
Welcome to my blog.  This is something I&rsquo;ve been talking about doing for some time now &ndash; and so it feels really good to finally get it off the ground.  (Thank you Octopress for making it so easy!)  On this blog I hope to have an outlet for thoughts and ramblings I have.  Hopefully people read it and find it helpful &ndash; but honestly I mainly want to use this as a way to get better at writing out my thoughts.  Enjoy.</p>
