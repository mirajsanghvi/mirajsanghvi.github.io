**Hello, World!**
Welcome to my blog.  This is something I've been talking about doing for some time now - and so it feels really good to finally get it off the ground.  (Thank you Octopress for making it so easy!)  On this blog I hope to have an outlet for thoughts and ramblings I have.  Hopefully people read it and find it helpful - but honestly I mainly want to use this as a way to get better at writing out my thoughts.  Enjoy.

<!-- more -->

As for the subject areas I plan to cover - it really will be all over the place: 

* news
* technology
* sports
* san francisco
* traveling
* food/eating
* coding
* machine learning/statistics
* advertising
* anything else
* the world

As you can see, this is a rather expansive list...especially the last 2 - there really should be something for everyone.  So with that, let's get this started.
